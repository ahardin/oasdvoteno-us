Well, the Oconomowoc referendum passed last night (along with many more throughout Wisconsin).

Here's my quick analysis of what went on in Wisconsin yesterday.

Wisconsin Republicans had tremendous success throughout the state. From Trump to Johnson to Ryan to all of the state legislature positions. Republicans carried the state.

I believe this is continued evidence of the resurgence of conservatism in Wisconsin. You can trace this back to Governor Walkers' numerous elections, Act 10, Right to Work, and so on.

But now I see these referenda that are completely **not conservative** passing all over the place.

I haven't done the complete math yet, but based on a quick assessment last night, we know that Wisconsin tax payers **voluntarily added well over $300 million to our tax burden** over the next 20 years. The real total is probably much more than this.

In general, I think there are two possible reasons for why this is happening.

**Scenario 1**: The passage of these referenda is a great demonstration of distributed government at work. These communities have made their decisions on how they want their tax dollars spent and how they want to be treated by local government.

**Scenario 2**: These referenda passed because of good campaigning and marketing by the school districts. They didn't necessarily pass because they are passionately supported by their communities.

I suspect it's scenario 2, but I don't know.

In either case, this site and the [videos on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/VoteNoOASD/) gained much more traction than I expected over the past 3 weeks. This tells me there is some interest from the community in keeping tabs on the school district (and possibly other government bodies as well). 

Even though the referendum passed, there is still work to be done. Even if you supported the referendum, I don't know how you can possibly trust the school district to spend your money responsibly after reading some of the findings on this site. 

If people continue to get value out of this site, I'll continue to investigate and report what I find.
