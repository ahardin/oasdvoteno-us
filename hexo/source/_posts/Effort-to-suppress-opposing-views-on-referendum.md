This is a big deal. 

I will recount the exact turn of events below. You can draw your own conclusions. Since it is difficult to recount an entire conversation from memory, I use quotes where I believe I recall the exact words used, and paraphrase where I don't.

This article seems long, but each line is very short. Read on.

## Round 1

Yesterday I participated in the following exchange on the OASD Facebook page (click to enlarge).

There were a couple of follow-on posts from another individual, but they're irrelevant to this discussion. The post seen above was my one and only post on the OASD Facebook page.

As of no later than 2:30pm today, that entire discussion has been **deleted**.

Strange, I thought. 

I had a call with OASD Director of Communications and Marketing, Kate Winckler. She said that she deleted the post(s) because they were in violation of the OASD Facebook page "rules of engagement". 

I was unaware of such rules.

She said that one rule specifically prohibits "links to other sites". Those were her words.

I said that I didn't realize that and asked whether I was allowed to post similar information right into the Facebook comment rather than via a link to another site. She said yes.

End of phone call.

I reviewed the rules of engagement. There is no rule as explicit as Kate described. The rules are as follows (and I have a screenshot of this as well). 

> Rules of Engagement: 
>
> We encourage our fans and visitors to this online community to engage with our district page. We do not pre-approve posts and comments prior to publication. However, we reserve the right to restrict or remove comments at our discretion. We allow both positive and negative feedback, as long as the content does not violate a few guidelines: 
>
>Keep it clean: Do not post graphic, obscene, explicit or discriminatory comments.
>
>Civility: We do not allow comments that are abusive, hateful, or intended to defame anyone or any organization. Please do not attempt to post content that is inflammatory and for the sole purpose of provoking arguments.
>
>No soliciting: We do not publish advertisements and solicitations. 
>
>Trolling: Spamming or trolling will be denied and may cause the author to be blocked from the page without notice.

I assumed that perhaps Kate categorized my link in the "advertisements or solicitations" bucket. 

Seemed like a stretch to me given that this site is purely informational with no ads or money transactions.

I sent an email to the superintendent, Roger Rindo, recounting the story to this point and asking for his thoughts. I also called his office three times. Haven't heard back yet, but that was only an hour or two ago at the time of writing this.

## Round 2

I was going to let the old horse die, but I wandered onto the OASD Facebook page again and noticed something else peculiar. 

**I have been blocked from posting comments on the OASD Facebook page!** 

<a href="/images/fb-no-comments.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/fb-no-comments.png" class="u-max-full-width" /></a>

So, I called Kate Winckler back, explained my latest observation, and asked if the ability to comment on the page had been disabled.

She said, "it might have."

I asked why this was done and also explained that I read the rules of engagement and did not see the rule that she had previously cited. 

She said my post was considered "spamming or trolling."

I've spent my share of time on the internet, and you'd have a hard time convincing me that my post is spamming or trolling. I explained this to Kate.

She said that's the way it is.

Not wanting to waste time arguing the semantics of internet discussion I changed gears back to the issue of comments being disabled. I again asked if she disabled it.

She said she'd have to check and that she didn't have it open in front of her.

I asked **who else has administrative access** to the Facebook page.

Kate said that she and her assistant do (she may have mentioned a 3rd person, but she was starting to trail off as we moved on).

I concluded the obvious that Kate either disabled commenting herself, or directed someone to do so.

I explained how concerning this is given the perception in the community that the district is stretching the bounds of what it is allowed to do to promote the passage of this referendum. This seems like an effort to suppress dissenting opinion, I said.

Kate explained that OASD does everything they are allowed to do within the law.

I challenged again and said that if someone had posted links to pictures of the students in the basement at the school, or kids in the trailers to drum up sympathy votes, she most likely would have let those stay on the page (speculation on my part, of course).

She explained how she understands my desire to have my opinion heard but these are the rules. 

I said this is much bigger than *my opinion* and reiterated the ethics and legal issue in question here.

She reiterated the *this is how it is* message.

I said that's fine, but I have an email out to Roger Rindo, will probably speak with him at the Meadowview open house event, and I have an interview with [Wisconsin Watchdog](http://watchdog.org/category/wisconsin/) tomorrow morning and that they will likely be happy to help investigate this.

End of phone call.
