title: Numerous OASD Facebook comments containing links

**This is part 2** of what apparently needs to be an *n* part series. [Read part 1 here](/news/Effort-to-suppress-opposing-views-on-referendum).

Using Facebook's Graph API (read: an automated way to analyze Facebook content), I searched through ALL of the posts and comments on the OASD Facebook page. Found were several comments containing links to other sites, most of which I have included below. 

Let me preface this post with this comment - am I so unreasonable as to think that if OASD has a "no links in the comments section" rule that they're going to catch and delete every single one of them? Of course not. 

However, their response to my posting of a purely informational link (a link to the home page of this site) was pretty strong. In case you didn't [read part 1](/news/Effort-to-suppress-opposing-views-on-referendum), they both deleted the post and **blocked** me from posting on the page.

If that is honestly the standard response for *anyone* who posts links on the OASD Facebook page, then that means they take it very seriously. And if that is the case, I would expect them to be highly vigilant about it for everyone.

Anyways, as has been the case throughout the past week's worth of reporting on this referendum situation, I will convey the facts along with some commentary. 

Note the following while viewing the screenshots below:

- Each post has just 1 comment. Therefore, there wasn't a frenzy of commenting activity that someone had to monitor in order to catch these.
- The comments are on the same day or within a few days of the original post.

Link to a page asking for donations (a true solicitation).

This one is truly strange. I would think if just one of the comments I've listed here would have been deleted, this would be the one.

Another solicitation.

**1/14/2015**

Here's another one.

**9/5/2014**

This is probably the best one. A true "troll" (which is the rule I am said to have broken). A photographer sees photos posted and posts links to photos of their own (nothing against Action Sports Photography).

<a href="/images/fb-comment-with-link7.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="/images/fb-comment-with-link7.PNG" class="u-max-full-width" /></a>

That's what we've got. There are a few more but you get the idea.

## Why?

OASD repeats the line about "understanding my need to have my opinion heard." It's not about that. 

This post and its predecessor are about the apparent fact that OASD took much stronger action to censor my information critical to the referendum than they do other content.

Finally, note that to date, OASD has not argued with a single factual claim that I have made. The financial information I exposed [here regarding employee benefits](/) and [here regarding state aid](/news/OASD-gets-12-7-state-aid-increase) is important information that voters should understand before voting on this referendum.
