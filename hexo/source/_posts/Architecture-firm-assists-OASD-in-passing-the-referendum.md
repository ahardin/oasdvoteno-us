Initially on this website I focused my efforts purely on the financial argument against this referendum. But then [the Facebook debacle](/news/Effort-to-suppress-opposing-views-on-referendum/) fell in my lap. Now, the brazenness of the way that the district is advocating for the passage of the referendum has become too much to ignore. 

Let's dive in.

Early in the referendum process, Oconomowoc Area School District [hired an architecture firm](http://archive.lakecountrynow.com/news/oconomowocfocus/research-group-finds-three-schools-in-the-oconomowoc-area-school-district-are-over-capacity-b9945994-295888571.html) called Eppstein Uhen Architecture (EUA). 

Here is how the district describes the relationship with EUA (from [the OASD website](http://www.oasd.k12.wi.us/page.cfm?p=6584)): 

> The district selected Eppstein Uhen Architects (EUA) in December 2014 after a competitive RFP and interview process. EUA also assists the district with pre-referendum work and community engagement.

Seems harmless enough, but my extensive research indicates that the way OASD is engaged with EUA represents both a massive conflict of interest, clearly violates the *spirit* of Wisconsin law (perhaps the letter as well), and even involves School Perceptions, LLC (the survey firm).

## Conflict of interest

Remember, OASD *hired* EUA. Although there is talk of an additional RFP being done if/after the referendum passes, the critically thinking mind will assume that EUA will be awarded the final work. Great fanfare has surrounded the designs and plans that EUA has created to this point, I do not see a scenario in which that is scrapped and a new firm is selected. Therefore, EUA is looking forward to significant financial gain if the referendum passes. If you think I'm being overly suspicious of conspiratorial behavior, please continue reading. 

The OASD community is being told that the major impetus for this referendum is capacity. How did we get there? All the way back in early 2015, EUA performed analysis of "facility needs" and concluded that three schools are over capacity. Meadow View Elementary by 75 people, Ixonia by 68, and OHS by 58.

Here are Meadow View's findings:

EUA then continued to create conceptual designs for the major building projects included in the referendum (you can see their name and logo stamped on all of the plan documents). 

Here's the one for Meadow View (click to enlarge):

You can view plans for the 3 large projects [on this page of the OASD website](http://www.oasd.k12.wi.us/page.cfm?p=8732).

What's particularly interesting is that by no later than March of 2015, before even obtaining these "capacity calculations", the district had already devised the clever **"Building our Future"** campaign slogan. That makes me think that their minds were pretty much set on extensive building projects, and they simply hired an outside contractor (EUA) to validate those desires.

## More on EUA

The [EUA website](http://www.eua.com/) reads more like a "hire us to pass your referendum" contractor than it does an above board architecture firm. But OASD *happened* to select them.

EUA employs personnel in a role titled "Public Information Specialist" or "Public Outreach Specialist." 

One of the Public Outreach Specialists assigned to the Oconomowoc referendum is a woman named Kit Dailey. Below is an except from her profile on the [EUA website](http://www.eua.com/people/kit-dailey) (emphasis added):

> As a public outreach specialist, Kit facilitates an effective flow of information between our clients and their constituencies. Over the course of the past 15 years she has **guided school districts**, technical colleges and other municipalities across several states **to secure more than $1 billion** in needed funding.

So, an individual working for a company *hired* by OASD with great incentive to pass the referendum has a job that revolves around *guiding school districts to secure funding* (i.e. pass referenda).

Not convinced? Here is a snippet from Dailey's LinkedIn page:

> At Eppstein Uhen Architects (EUA), we believe creating an effective flow of information between our clients and their communities is vital for any public building initiative to be successful. **Our goal is to help our clients position themselves to secure funding through the often difficult referenda process.**

So, an outside firm (EUA) that would reap great benefits from a successful referendum **is the same firm** that advised the district on how desparately they "needed" the referendum!

Might the schools be genuinely over capacity? Sure. But that is far beside the point. Given that the district is spending *our* dollars (54.9 million of them), I think it's reasonable to expect some objectivity in the research and analysis process.

## Tie-in to School Perceptions!

This is where this gets interesting and becomes a disappointing display of corruption in our very own local government. 

School Perceptions (aka Community Perceptions), run by Bill Foster, is the organization that helps school districts guage a community's appetite for a budget referendum. 

School Perceptions conducted OASD's survey in April of 2016 ([more on that at the OASD site](http://www.oasd.k12.wi.us/page.cfm?p=8492)). Review the results if you'd like, but they're irrelevant to this discussion.

Remember, OASD **hired** both EUA (Kit Dailey) and School Perceptions (Bill Foster).

These are **supposed** to be two independent organizations that provide objective, 3rd party value to the process.

It turns out, not only do both of these organizations have an **overt focus on passing referenda**, but they are also quite friendly with one another. 

On EUA's own website you'll find a quote from Bill Foster (School Perceptions). It reads:

> I have had the opportunity to partner with EUA on dozens of community engagement projects to help districts navigate the public outreach process. Beyond designing great schools, EUA provides expertise with coordination of integrated communications planning and effective public participation strategy.  EUA’s leadership, comprehensive public outreach services and creation of innovative, flexible learning environments delivers a total solution to their clients.”
>
> \- Bill Foster, President School Perceptions

There is a lot of fancy phraseology in there. "Integrated communications planning", "public participation", "public outreach". All of this is talking about how they can help school districts **pass their referenda**.

Still don't believe it?

In 2013, Bill Foster and Kit Dailey did a joint presentation at "Wisconsin's 92nd state education convention" ([see brochure](http://www.wasb.org/websites/convention/File/2013/2013_wednesday_printer_friendly.pdf)). Their timeslot was 1:30 PM on January 23rd and the session was called "Ten Mistakes to Avoid When Planning Your Next Referendum". The presention abstract read (emphasis added):

> The process for **passing** a referendum seems simple: create broad public awareness of the problems and propose a solution that represents what a majority of the community will support. But the **road to success** is filled with pot-holes and rabbit trails. **Bill Foster** of School Perceptions and **Kit Dailey** of Eppstein Uhen Architects have **helped over 300 districts navigate the budget**, referendum and facility planning processes. They have learned what works and where districts stumble. This presentation will highlight 10 common mistakes districts make and provides advice on how to avoid them.

If we were talking in person I would be yelling right now. **They are bragging about helping 300 districts pass referenda!** That is not their job! The school distric is supposed to objectively inform the community about the pros and cons of the referendum and let the taxpayers make a decision. 

But they aren't doing that, are they? The school districts are paying outside partners to skillfully craft their communication (remember what Bill Foster said EUA is so good at) in order to nearly ensure a successful "yes" vote on the referendum. 

This is the epitome of unethical, dishonest, and arrogant behavior.    

Are you OK with this? 

Are you OK with the obvious conflict of interest?

Are you OK with the fact that the district claims over and over again to be doing nothing more than "informing" the community when their partners obviously have been hired not to inform, but to pass the referendum?

Are you OK with the fact that if it weren't for some random citizen who doesn't know when to stop digging you would have know idea this is how the process worked?

I'm not.

Even if you think the referendum projects are a good thing, I believe you should be outraged that **your** school leadership is pulling the wool over your eyes and playing you for a chump.

## What can you do about this?

Call Superintendent Roger Rindo and demand an explanation for everything I've covered in this article. 

Call your school board members and do the same.

And of course, get yourself and as many of your friends as possible to Vote No to stop this travesty.





## Spirit of the law

OASD says that EUA "also assists the district with pre-referendum work and **community engagement**."

What is community engagement? We don't have to speculate. 

Aside from being shady beyond measure, this is **illegal**. Wisconsin state law prohibits school districts from using taxpayer funds to "advocate the passage or defeat of a referendum". [Refer to this summary of the statutes](http://elections.wi.gov/sites/default/files/guideline/24/1258_referenda_pdf_49934.pdf) for more details.

I'm sure EUA knows how to spin around the semantics of this law to make it difficult to prosecute. [Browse through their portfolio](http://www.eua.com/markets/learn/k12) and you'll see referendum after referendum that they've helped schools pass. This isn't their first rodeo.

By the way - anecdotally I would say there is a 80% chance that if you're reading this you've recently complained about corruption in Washington. Washington Corruption very often takes the form of what's called crony capitalism. It looks **just like this**.

Are you OK with that? 

Even if a court ruled the OASD-EUA relationship legal, are you OK with the obvious conflict of interest?

Are you OK with the fact that if it weren't for some random citizen who doesn't know when to stop digging you would have know idea this is how the process worked?

I'm not.
