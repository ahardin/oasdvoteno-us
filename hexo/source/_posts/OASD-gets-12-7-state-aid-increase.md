You heard it here first, folks!

Despite anticipating a decrease of up to 8% in state aid (per the OASD 2016 budget proposal), OASD is receiving an **increase of 12.7%**. That's *$1.19 million*! Technically it's $1,187,778, but seriously, who's counting?

In a process so convoluted it could have only been devised by a massive bureaucracy, each year in mid-October the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) announces the amount of state aid each school district will receive. These numbers are now available.

This raises two things we should bear in mind.

## Property taxes
There are more factors than just state aid, but, given this huge amount I would expect the property tax levy to decrease for 2016 (or 2017, depending on when the adjustment can be made). Property taxes increased in 2015 when state aid decreased by only 6%.

From the 2016-17 OASD budget proposal (emphasis added):
> OASD"s (sic) tax rate is expected to increase each year with the anticipated loss of State Equalization Aid.

Well, Equalization Aid (what I'm referring to as "state aid") went up. Way up.

Also, here is OASD's exact rationale for the tax increase last year. From the 2015-16 annual report (emphasis added): 
> The November 2015 property tax levy increased by 3.47% due to a **loss in state aid** and growth in the ‘three-year-rolling-average’ student enrollment. The equalized tax rate increased by .43%, as a result of the factors noted above being offset by increasing equalized property values.

## Spending
We must watch with absolute eagle-eyes what the district does with these additional dollars. We should demand that unexpected funds such as this be used for high priority needs (some of the maintenance items in the referendum, perhaps) and not on frivolities or boondoggle projects. Throughout this referendum we've heard constant complaints and excuse making that state aid has been cut and the operating budget doesn't have room for dealing with these expenses. Well here we go. Over a million [do-just-about-whatever-you-want-with-them](http://dpi.wi.gov/sfs/statistical/basic-facts/section-f "Wisconsin DPI Website") dollars that were unexpected from Madison. 

A wonderful opportunity for the district to act in the best interest of the taxpayers.
