        <h2>Oconomowoc Area School District 2016 Referendum</h2>
        <p>On November 8th, members of the Oconomowoc Area School District will have the option to vote either "Yes" or "No" on a <strong>$54.9 million</strong> tax referendum. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe you should vote "No".

    <h4>Why Vote No</h4>
    <p>
        The OASD school board has not taken sufficient steps to economize the district's budget in order to avoid the "need" for such a referendum.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>My argument is summed up very simply: The District owes the taxpayers a much more significant effort to reduce costs before asking us for $54,900,000.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Below are a number of key cost areas that could be cut, as well as some additional thoughts and background.

    <h5 id="health-insurance">Health Insurance</h5>
    <p>
      The District (i.e. the taxpayer) pays <strong>94%</strong> of employees' health insurance premiums (single and family).
    </p>
    
      <p>
      An individual employee's share of the annual premium is <strong>$499.31</strong>, leaving <strong>$7,439.69</strong> to the taxpayer.
    </p>

      <img alt="Premiums Chart" src="images/premium-share-single.png?bust=1234" class="u-max-full-width">
    </p>
    
    <p>
        An employee + family's share of the <strong>annual</strong> premium is <strong>$1,164.90</strong>, leaving <strong>$17,276.10</strong> to the taxpayer.
    </p>

    Other Facts
    <ul>
      <li>
        According to BLS: on average, employers only cover between <strong>68% and 71%</strong> of health insurance premiums (and that includes public sector).
      </li>
      <li>
        OASD's Alternate Benefit Plan allows employees who decline health coverage (e.g. because they have coverage through a spouse) a stipend of <strong>$5,000</strong>. This is outrageously high. My past employer offered $2,000. 
      </li>
      <li>
        OASD's total Employee Benefits expense is about $12,000,000 annually.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="post-employment">Post-Employment Benefits</h5>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Employees who retire between the age of 57 and 64 are entitled to contributions of $16,000 (family) or $7,000 (single) into a Health Reimbursement Account (HRA).
      </li>
      <li>
        What this effectively means is that <strong>retirees</strong> have their health insurance covered by OASD for 5-6 years after they're no longer employed by the district. 
      </li>
      <li>
          These contributions last for 5-6 years depending on when the employee retires.
      </li>
      <li>
        Note: this program is being phased out, but it will still be in effect for another 16 years or so.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="retirement-savings">Retirement Savings</h5>

    <ul>
      <li>The District offers up to a $600 match for 403(b) retirement accounts (similar to a 401(k)). This is in addition to the contributions that the District is required to make to the employees' Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) accounts.</li>
      <li>
        The District is required to make contributions of 6.6% of pay for each employee to WRS.
      </li>
      <li>I would drop the 403(b) match altogether given how great of a retirement plan WRS is.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="wisconsin">For the Good of Wisconsin</h5>
    <p>
      Throughout Wisconsin on November 8th there will be several dozen referendums similar to Oconomowoc's. The combined dollar amount of all of them is over <strong>$1.3 billion</strong>. This is staggering. We need to be doing everything we can to stop Wisconsin from being the "tax hell" that it is. Voting into place what amounts to increased property taxes for entire communities does not help. 
    </p>

    <h5 id="conservatism">For the Self-Described "Conservatives"</h5>
    <p>
      We Conservatives often take pride in our fight for low taxes, balanced budgets, and minimal government spending. However, it's more than a little hypocritical when, just because a <em>school</em> is involved, Conservatives are more than willing to spend obscene amounts of money with little to no accountability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember that when you say, "but <em>our</em> community really needs this", everyone of the other 60+ communities voting on a massive referendum is saying the same thing. 
    </p>

    <h5 id="conclusion">In Conclusion</h5>

    <p>
      In addition to spending many hours digging through the referenced materials, I discussed these matters directly with OASD staff. At the October 17th referendum meeting at OHS I respectfully and passionately questioned both the Superintendent (Roger Rindo) and the OHS principal (Joseph Moylan). I directly (one-on-one and in a group) asked both Mr. Rindo and Mr. Moylan about most of the items above and why action has not been taken on them.
    </p> 

    <p>
      While we had a nice discussion, I did not receive satisfactory answers. The only answer that was given was that the cuts that I propose cannot be made because OASD needs to remain a desirable place to work. Obviously OASD needs to retain talent. But I find it hard to believe that there would be a mass exodus from OASD if employees had to pay higher premiums, for example. Especially considering the other communities that I researched (Mequon-Thiensville and Waterford*) require 11% and 15% of health premium costs from their employees. Based on what I was told, I can only conclude that no steps have been taken to either control spending in these specific areas or even to evaluate possibilities for control.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: .8em">
      * Not cherry-picking, these are the schools whose data was readily available.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you come away from this page thinking, "wow this guy's a jerk and must hate kids and education" then you did not carefully read everything I wrote. I will summarize again in a different way: some of what OASD is asking for <em>may</em> need to get done, but we have numerous, excessive expenses that can and must be reduced before saddling ourselves with 20 more years of debt and increased property taxes.
