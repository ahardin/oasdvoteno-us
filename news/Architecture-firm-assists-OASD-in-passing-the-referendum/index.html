            <p>Initially on this website I focused my efforts purely on the financial argument against this referendum. But then <a href="/news/Effort-to-suppress-opposing-views-on-referendum/">the Facebook debacle</a> fell in my lap. Now, the brazenness of the way that the district is advocating for the passage of the referendum has become too much to ignore. </p>
<p>Early in the referendum process, Oconomowoc Area School District <a href="http://archive.lakecountrynow.com/news/oconomowocfocus/research-group-finds-three-schools-in-the-oconomowoc-area-school-district-are-over-capacity-b9945994-295888571.html" target="_blank" rel="external">hired an architecture firm</a> called Eppstein Uhen Architecture (EUA). </p>
<p>Here is how the district describes the relationship with EUA (from <a href="http://www.oasd.k12.wi.us/page.cfm?p=6584" target="_blank" rel="external">the OASD website</a>, emphasis added): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The district selected Eppstein Uhen Architects (EUA) in December 2014 after a competitive RFP and interview process. EUA also assists the district with pre-referendum work and community engagement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My research indicates that the way OASD engaged EUA represents both a massive conflict of interest and something very much resembling illegal activity.</p>
<h2 id="Conflict-of-interest"><a href="#Conflict-of-interest" class="headerlink" title="Conflict of interest"></a>Conflict of interest</h2><p>Remember, OASD <em>hired</em> EUA. Although there is talk of an additional RFP being done if/after the referendum passes, the critically thinking mind will assume that EUA will be awarded the final work. Great fanfare has surrounded the designs and plans that EUA has created to this point, I don’t see a scenario in which that is scrapped and a new firm is selected. Therefore, EUA is looking forward to significant financial gain if the referendum passes.</p>
<p>All the way back in early 2015, EUA performed analysis of “facility needs” and concluded that three schools are over capacity. EUA then continued to create the designs for the major building projects included in the referendum (you can see their name and logo stamped on all of the plan documents).</p>
<p>So, an outside firm (EUA) that would reap great benefits from a successful referendum <strong>is the same firm</strong> that advised the district on how desparately they “needed” the referendum!</p>
<p>Might the schools be genuinely over capacity? Sure. But that is far beside the point. Given that the district is spending <em>our</em> dollars (54.9 million of them), I think it’s reasonable to expect some objectivity in the research and analysis process.</p>
<h2 id="Illegal-advocacy"><a href="#Illegal-advocacy" class="headerlink" title="Illegal advocacy"></a>Illegal advocacy</h2><p>OASD says that EUA “also assists the district with pre-referendum work and <strong>community engagement</strong>.”</p>
<p>What is community engagement? We don’t have to speculate. </p>
<p>EUA employs personnel in a role titled “Public Information Specialist” or “Public Outreach Specialist.” </p>
<p>One of the Public Outreach Specialists assigned to the Oconomowoc referendum is a woman named Kit Dailey. Below is an except from her profile on the <a href="http://www.eua.com/people/kit-dailey" target="_blank" rel="external">EUA website</a> (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a public outreach specialist, Kit facilitates an effective flow of information between our clients and their constituencies. Over the course of the past 15 years she has <strong>guided school districts</strong>, technical colleges and other municipalities across several states <strong>to secure more than $1 billion</strong> in needed funding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, an individual working for a company <em>hired</em> by OASD with great incentive to pass the referendum has a job that revolves around <em>guiding school districts to secure funding</em> (i.e. pass referenda).</p>
<p>Not convinced? Here is a snippet from Dailey’s LinkedIn page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Eppstein Uhen Architects (EUA), we believe creating an effective flow of information between our clients and their communities is vital for any public building initiative to be successful. <strong>Our goal is to help our clients position themselves to secure funding through the often difficult referenda process.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A note before going any further: nothing in this article should be interpreted as an accusation against Kit Dailey. Dailey happens to be the employee</p>
<p>Aside from being shady beyond measure, this is <strong>illegal</strong>. Wisconsin state law prohibits school districts from using taxpayer funds to “advocate the passage or defeat of a referendum”. <a href="http://elections.wi.gov/sites/default/files/guideline/24/1258_referenda_pdf_49934.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">Refer to this summary of the statutes</a> for more details.</p>
<p>I’m sure EUA knows how to spin around the semantics of this law to make it difficult to prosecute. <a href="http://www.eua.com/markets/learn/k12" target="_blank" rel="external">Browse through their portfolio</a> and you’ll see referendum after referendum that they’ve helped schools pass. This isn’t their first rodeo.</p>
<p>Are you OK with that? </p>
<p>Even if a court ruled the OASD-EUA relationship legal, are you OK with the obvious conflict of interest?</p>
<p>Are you OK with the fact that if it weren’t for some random citizen who doesn’t know when to stop digging you would have know idea this is how the process worked?</p>
<p>I’m not.</p>
