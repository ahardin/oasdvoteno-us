            <p><strong>This is part 2</strong> of what apparently needs to be an <em>n</em> part series. <a href="/news/Effort-to-suppress-opposing-views-on-referendum">Read part 1 here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Using Facebook’s Graph API (read: an automated way to analyze Facebook content), I searched through ALL of the posts and comments on the OASD Facebook page. Found were several comments containing links to other sites, most of which I have included below. </p>
<p>Let me preface this post with this comment - am I so unreasonable as to think that if OASD has a “no links in the comments section” rule that they’re going to catch and delete every single one of them? Of course not. </p>
<p>However, their response to my posting of a purely informational link (a link to the home page of this site) was pretty strong. In case you didn’t <a href="/news/Effort-to-suppress-opposing-views-on-referendum">read part 1</a>, they both deleted the post and <strong>blocked</strong> me from posting on the page.</p>
<p>If that is honestly the standard response for <em>anyone</em> who posts links on the OASD Facebook page, then that means they take it very seriously. And if that is the case, I would expect them to be highly vigilant about it for everyone.</p>
<p>Anyways, as has been the case throughout the past week’s worth of reporting on this referendum situation, I will convey the facts along with some commentary. </p>
<p>Note the following while viewing the screenshots below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each post has just 1 comment. Therefore, there wasn’t a frenzy of commenting activity that someone had to monitor in order to catch these.</li>
<li>The comments are on the same day or within a few days of the original post.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can click any of the images to make them bigger.</p>
<p><strong>8/4/2016</strong></p>
<p>Link to a book on Amazon.</p>

<p><strong>9/28/2016</strong></p>
<p>Link to another Facebook page.</p>

<p><strong>3/25/2016</strong></p>
<p>Link to a page asking for donations (a true solicitation).</p>

<p><strong>10/28/2015</strong></p>
<p>This one is truly strange. I would think if just one of the comments I’ve listed here would have been deleted, this would be the one.</p>
<p><a href="/images/fb-comment-with-link4pt1.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="/images/fb-comment-with-link4pt1.PNG" class="u-max-full-width"></a></p>

<p><strong>9/23/2015</strong></p>
<p>Another solicitation.</p>

<p><strong>1/14/2015</strong></p>
<p>Here’s another one.</p>
<p><a href="/images/fb-comment-with-link6.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="/images/fb-comment-with-link6.PNG" class="u-max-full-width"></a></p>
<p><strong>9/5/2014</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the best one. A true “troll” (which is the rule I am said to have broken). A photographer sees photos posted and posts links to photos of their own (nothing against Action Sports Photography).</p>
<p><a href="/images/fb-comment-with-link7.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="/images/fb-comment-with-link7.PNG" class="u-max-full-width"></a></p>
<p>That’s what we’ve got. There are a few more but you get the idea.</p>
<h2 id="Why"><a href="#Why" class="headerlink" title="Why?"></a>Why?</h2><p>OASD repeats the line about “understanding my need to have my opinion heard.” It’s not about that. </p>
<p>This post and its predecessor are about the apparent fact that OASD took much stronger action to censor my information critical to the referendum than they do other content.</p>
<p>Finally, note that to date, OASD has not argued with a single factual claim that I have made. The financial information I exposed <a href="/">here regarding employee benefits</a> and <a href="/news/OASD-gets-12-7-state-aid-increase">here regarding state aid</a> is important information that voters should understand before voting on this referendum. </p>
