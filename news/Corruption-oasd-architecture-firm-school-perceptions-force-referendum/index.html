            <p>Initially on this website I focused my efforts purely on the financial argument against this referendum. But then <a href="/news/Effort-to-suppress-opposing-views-on-referendum/">the Facebook debacle</a> fell in my lap. Now, the brazenness of the way that the district is advocating for the passage of the referendum has become too much to ignore. </p>
<p>This is a little complicated and takes some explaining. Stay with me.</p>
<p>Early in the referendum process, Oconomowoc Area School District <a href="http://archive.lakecountrynow.com/news/oconomowocfocus/research-group-finds-three-schools-in-the-oconomowoc-area-school-district-are-over-capacity-b9945994-295888571.html" target="_blank" rel="external">hired an architecture firm</a> called Eppstein Uhen Architecture (EUA). </p>
<p>Here is how the district describes the relationship with EUA (from <a href="http://www.oasd.k12.wi.us/page.cfm?p=6584" target="_blank" rel="external">the OASD website</a>): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The district selected Eppstein Uhen Architects (EUA) in December 2014 after a competitive RFP and interview process. EUA also assists the district with pre-referendum work and community engagement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems harmless enough, but my extensive research indicates that the way in which OASD has engaged both EUA and School Perceptions (more on that later) is intended to aggressively force the referendum to pass without community members knowing any better.</p>
<h2 id="First-conflict-of-interest"><a href="#First-conflict-of-interest" class="headerlink" title="First conflict of interest"></a>First conflict of interest</h2><p>Remember, OASD <em>hired</em> EUA. Although there is talk of an additional RFP being done if/after the referendum passes, the critically thinking mind will assume that EUA will be awarded the final work. Great fanfare has surrounded the designs and plans that EUA has created to this point, I do not see a scenario in which that is scrapped and a new firm is selected. Therefore, EUA is looking forward to significant financial gain if the referendum passes. If you think this is an unfair assumption, please continue reading. It will become more clear. </p>
<p>The OASD community is being told that the major impetus for this referendum is capacity. How did they decide that? All the way back in early 2015, EUA performed an analysis of “facility needs” and concluded that three schools are over capacity. Meadow View Elementary by 75, Ixonia by 68, and OHS by 58.</p>
<p>Here are some of the details of Meadow View’s findings:</p>
<p><a href="/images/eua-capacity-ohs-summary-compressor.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/eua-capacity-ohs-summary-compressor.jpg" class="u-max-full-width"></a></p>
<p>EUA then continued to create conceptual designs for the major building projects included in the referendum. </p>
<p>Here’s the one for Meadow View (click to enlarge):</p>
<p><a href="/images/meadowview-plan-markup.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/meadowview-plan-markup.jpg" class="u-max-full-width"></a></p>
<p>Plans for the other large projects can be viewed <a href="http://www.oasd.k12.wi.us/page.cfm?p=8732" target="_blank" rel="external">on this page of the OASD website</a>.</p>
<p>What’s particularly interesting is that by no later than March of 2015, before even obtaining these “capacity calculations”, the district had already devised the clever <strong>“Building our Future”</strong> campaign slogan. This makes me think that their minds were basically set on extensive building projects, and they simply hired an outside contractor (EUA) to validate those plans.</p>
<p><a href="/images/eua-capacity-cover-markup-compressor.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/eua-capacity-cover-markup-compressor.jpg" class="u-max-full-width"></a></p>
<p>Clearly we need to understand more about EUA.</p>
<h2 id="More-on-EUA"><a href="#More-on-EUA" class="headerlink" title="More on EUA"></a>More on EUA</h2><p>EUA employs personnel in a role titled “Public Information Specialist” or “Public Outreach Specialist.” </p>
<p>One of the Public Outreach Specialists assigned to the Oconomowoc referendum is a woman named Kit Dailey. Below is an excerpt from her profile on the <a href="http://www.eua.com/people/kit-dailey" target="_blank" rel="external">EUA website</a> (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a public outreach specialist, Kit facilitates an effective flow of information between our clients and their constituencies. Over the course of the past 15 years she has <strong>guided school districts</strong>, technical colleges and other municipalities across several states <strong>to secure more than $1 billion</strong> in needed funding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, an individual working for a company <em>hired</em> by OASD with great incentive to pass the referendum has a job that revolves around <em>guiding school districts to secure funding</em> (i.e. pass referenda).</p>
<p>Not convinced? Here is a snippet from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kit-dailey-6a923220" target="_blank" rel="external">Dailey’s LinkedIn page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 15 years of working with public clients, <strong>Kit has helped pass 127 referenda questions</strong> to secure more than $1 billion in needed funding nationwide. <strong>Kit has guided schools</strong>, technical colleges, libraries, park districts and municipalities <strong>through each step of the challenging referenda process</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Eppstein Uhen Architects (EUA), we believe creating an effective flow of information between our clients and their communities is vital for any public building initiative to be successful. Our goal is to <strong>help our clients position themselves to secure funding through the often difficult referenda process</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still not convinced? Many of the case studies available on the EUA website brag about the referendum funds EUA helped districts secure in order to fund their building projects. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.eua.com/markets/projects/menasha-high-school" target="_blank" rel="external">Menasha High School</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comprehensive community engagement strategies resulted in the district passing a $29.9M referendum with 73% voter support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.eua.com/markets/projects/lake-mills-elementary-school?category=learn" target="_blank" rel="external">Lake Mills Elementary</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With strategic guidance from EUA’s Public Outreach Specialists, the district passed an $18.7M referendum for a new school, an important accomplishment only four years after the approval of a significant middle school renovation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.eua.com/markets/projects/waunakee-school-district?category=learn" target="_blank" rel="external">Waunakee Community School District</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>EUA’s Public Information Specialists provided communication and engagement strategies to pass two referendum questions for new construction and renovation of schools ($44.8M) and associated recurring operational costs ($2.16M).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To summarize: </p>
<ul>
<li>EUA advised OASD on how desparately they “need” the referendum</li>
<li>EUA stands to reap great financial gains from a successful referendum</li>
<li>EUA repeatedly states that their purpose is to help schools <strong>pass referenda</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It gets better (or worse).</p>
<h2 id="Down-the-rabbit-hole-enter-School-Perceptions"><a href="#Down-the-rabbit-hole-enter-School-Perceptions" class="headerlink" title="Down the rabbit hole: enter School Perceptions"></a>Down the rabbit hole: enter School Perceptions</h2><p>This is where this gets interesting and becomes a disappointing display of corruption in our own local government. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.schoolperceptions.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">School Perceptions</a> (aka Community Perceptions), run by Bill Foster, is the organization that helps school districts gauge a community’s appetite for a budget referendum via community surveys. </p>
<p>School Perceptions conducted OASD’s survey in April of 2016. <a href="http://www.oasd.k12.wi.us/page.cfm?p=8492" target="_blank" rel="external">Review the survey results</a> if you’d like, but they’re irrelevant to this discussion.</p>
<p>Remember, OASD <strong>hired</strong> both EUA (Kit Dailey) and School Perceptions (Bill Foster).</p>
<p>These are <strong>supposed</strong> to be two independent organizations that provide objective, 3rd party value to the process.</p>
<p>Wisconsin state law prohibits school districts from using taxpayer funds to “advocate the passage or defeat of a referendum” (<a href="http://elections.wi.gov/sites/default/files/guideline/24/1258_referenda_pdf_49934.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">see statute summary</a>). Though, I’m sure these organizations have figured out how to dance around the letter of the law.</p>
<p>Moving on. It turns out, not only do both of these organizations have an <strong>overt focus on passing referenda</strong>, but they are also quite friendly with one another. </p>
<p>On EUA’s <a href="http://www.eua.com/practice/expertise/learn/public-outreach" target="_blank" rel="external">own website</a> you’ll find a quote from Bill Foster. It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have had the opportunity to partner with EUA on dozens of community engagement projects to help districts navigate the public outreach process. Beyond designing great schools, EUA provides expertise with coordination of integrated communications planning and effective public participation strategy.  EUA’s leadership, comprehensive public outreach services and creation of innovative, flexible learning environments delivers a total solution to their clients.”</p>
<p>- Bill Foster, President School Perceptions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a lot of fancy phraseology in there. “Integrated communications planning”, “public participation”, “public outreach”. All of this is talking about how they can help school districts <strong>pass referenda</strong>.</p>
<p>Still don’t believe it?</p>
<p>In 2013, Bill Foster and Kit Dailey did a joint presentation at “Wisconsin’s 92nd state education convention” (<a href="http://www.wasb.org/websites/convention/File/2013/2013_wednesday_printer_friendly.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">see event brochure</a>). Their timeslot was 1:30 PM on January 23rd and the session was called “Ten Mistakes to Avoid When Planning Your Next Referendum”. The presentation abstract read (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process for <strong>passing</strong> a referendum seems simple: create broad public awareness of the problems and propose a solution that represents what a majority of the community will support. But the <strong>road to success</strong> is filled with pot-holes and rabbit trails. <strong>Bill Foster</strong> of School Perceptions and <strong>Kit Dailey</strong> of Eppstein Uhen Architects have <strong>helped over 300 districts navigate the budget, referendum and facility planning processes</strong>. They have learned what works and where districts stumble. This presentation will highlight 10 common mistakes districts make and provides advice on how to avoid them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>They are bragging about helping 300 districts pass referenda!</strong> That is not their job! The school district is supposed to objectively inform the community about the pros and cons of the referendum and let the taxpayers make a decision. </p>
<p>But they aren’t doing that, are they? The school districts are paying outside partners to skillfully craft their communication in order to nearly ensure a successful “yes” vote on the referendum. Remember what Bill Foster said EUA is so good at. This is their racket. And by the way, this is going on throughout the state, not just in OASD.</p>
<p>This is the epitome of unethical, dishonest, and arrogant behavior.    </p>
<p>Are you OK with this? </p>
<p>Are you OK with the obvious conflict of interest?</p>
<p>Are you OK with the fact that the district claims repeatedly to be doing nothing more than “informing” the community, when their partners obviously have been hired not to inform, but to pass the referendum?</p>
<p>Are you OK with the fact that if it weren’t for some random citizen who doesn’t know when to stop digging you would have no idea this is how the process worked?</p>
<p>I’m not.</p>
<p>Regardless of the merit of the referendum projects, it is outrageous that our school leadership is pulling the wool over our eyes and playing us for chumps.</p>
